Hi all,

Thanks for signing up.

Currently there’s about 26 people signed up. We can run with that as I have both G02 and G02A booked.

Please let me know  if it turns out you can’t make it. No problem -it’d  just be good to know.

I set up the Doodle whilst in France so it says 1-4pm UK but as per original email the workshop is running 2 - 5pm UK (sorry - Doodle is smarter than me).

If you’d like to use your own laptop please install R and RStudio. Both are free and available from the following links..

	R - https://cran.r-project.org

	RStudio  - https://cran.r-project.org

	The attached R-RStudio-install.pdf has screen grabs of the installation links for Windows/Macs.

	To test your installation start RStudio (not R).
	You should see something that looks like the attached RStudio.png with a flashing vertical ‘cursor’ next to the ‘>’ in the big window.
	If you type 2 + 3 and then press the ‘enter’ key on your keyboard you should get the response [1] 5
	If that happens RStudio and R are installed and working so you are good to go.

	Any problems with installation drop me an email so we can get going on Wednesday without having to worry about install issues. If your’e not brining a laptop there are ample PC’s in G02 with R and RStudio pre-installed.

On Wednesday you’ll need to download some data and R files onto your laptop or PC in G02. Could you check before then that you can see contents of the following Dropbox shared folder? Just now there’s just one file ‘aliendata-20180331.xlsx'

Right. That’s it for now.

See you Wednesday afternoon.

Cheers

Ian

Hi all,

We’ll be running an "R Workshop for beginners" on Wednesday 4th April.

It’ll be in G02 in the Vet School from 1400 to 1700 

It is aimed at people who have not used R at all or have tried and abandoned R very quickly.

It’s 'hands-on’ with R available on the PCs (or bring a laptop - install instructions to follow).

Together we’ll:

Import an example dataset
Tidy and clean it.
Summarise different variables
Generate histograms, scatterplots, box plots (and more perhaps)
Run a simple statistical hypothesis test on the data.
Maybe (time  permitting) fit a simple regression model to the data.

You’ll leave the workshop with a script file that you’ll have edited which will do all of the above and generate a report containing the code and results from the session.

There’ll be plenty of help available! We’ll also discuss ‘next steps’ with learning R.

If you’d like to come along sign up here…

There are 20 places for this workshop (first 20 signups get priority) so if demand exceeds this we’ll run more workshops soon.

We’ll circulate some pre-course info early next week.

Cheers
