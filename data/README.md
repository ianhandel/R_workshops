# R Workshops Data

This data was downloaded from the UK data archive on 16/02/2018 from Study Number 8207 - Harmonised Height, Weight and BMI in Five Longitudinal Cohort Studies: National Child Development Study, 1970 British Cohort Study and Millennium Cohort Study.
The data has been edited from longitduinal to cross sectional data - the data was cut to entries taken when participants were 30 years of age. 
Several columns have also been cut out of the original data or renamed and the data now only contains information about participants ID, sex, weight, height, bmi and whether their weight and heights were recorded by themselves or by the study investigators.
