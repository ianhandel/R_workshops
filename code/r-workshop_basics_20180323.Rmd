### Creating R 'objects' and storing numbers in them.

```{r}
# put 99 into an object called 'x' then show what's in 'x'
x <- 99
x

# put 53 into an object called 'age' then show what's in 'age'
age <- 53
age

# put what's in 'x' into 'age' and show what's in 'age
age  <- x
age

# put integers 1 to 10 into 'nums' and show what's in 'nums'
nums <- 2:10
nums

# show the square root of each number in 'nums'
sqrt(nums)

# show the total of the numbers in 'nums'
sum(nums)

# show the arithemtic mean of what's in 'nums'
mean(nums)
```

### Try some other functions
```{r}
length(nums)
rev(nums)
sample(nums)
sample(nums)
min(nums)
max(nums)
median(nums)
```

### Rivers data
```{r}
rivers

mean(rivers)
min(rivers)
max(rivers)
length(rivers)

```




### Loading 'add-in' packages

```{r}
library(tidyverse) # to tidy, manipulate and explore data
```

### Introducing the 'pipe'

```{r}
# put the square root of 'nums' into 'roots'
# then put the sum of that into sum_roots
roots <- sqrt(nums)
sum_roots <- sum(roots)
sum_roots
```

```{r}
# as above using the 'pipe'
sum_roots <- nums %>% sqrt() %>% sum()
sum_roots
```
